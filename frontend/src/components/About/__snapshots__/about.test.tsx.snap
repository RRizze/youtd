        Game Elements
      </h2>
      <p>
        Towers are devided in seven categories. They are fire, ice, storm, iron, nature, astral, darkness. So if you want to design a tower, you have to choose to which category it belongs to. The categories have different attack types, appearances and preferred special abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is a short description of the elements:
      </p>
      <ul
        className="game-elements category-list"
      >
        <li
          className="category-list__item"
        >
          <span
            className="fire"
          >
            Fire: 
          </span>
          The element of destruction. Fire towers set their focus on pure damage. They have good high damage and splash damage towers but lack special abilities, all they do is damage. Fire towers look fiery, red and contain red units like fel orcs and other red stuff.
        </li>
        <li
          className="category-list__item"
        >
          <span
            className="nature"
          >
            Nature: 
          </span>
          The element of life. Nature towers focus on supportive effects that enhance other towers. Nature towers look like plants. They can contain animals and night elves.
        </li>
        <li
          className="category-list__item"
        >
          <span
            className="darkness"
          >
            Darkness: 
          </span>
          The "evil" element. Focusses on curses, necromantism and generally abilities that weaken the enemy. Darkness towers look very dark, surrounded by skulls, bones and bodies. They can contain undead units and demons.
        </li>
        <li
          className="category-list__item"
        >
          <span
            className="astral"
          >
            Astral: 
          </span>
          As opposed to darkness, this is the "good" element. It focusses on astral stuff (starfall, moon/sun beams, and so on) and positive effects. Its towers look like shiny ancient ruins. They can contain blood elfs.
        </li>
        <li
          className="category-list__item"
        >
          <span
            className="iron"
          >
            Iron: 
          </span>
          The manmade element. It consists of towers and machines made by humans. It has alround abilities but lacks of great magic. Its towers look like real towers or machines. They can contain humans, dwarfs, goblins and other tinkering creatures.
        </li>
        <li
          className="category-list__item"
        >
          <span
            className="storm"
          >
            Storm: 
          </span>
          The weather element. Focusses on weather effects like storms, tornados, fog and especially lightning. Its towers are surrounded by lightning and storm.
        </li>
        <li
          className="category-list__item"
        >
          <span
            className="ice"
          >
            Ice: 
          </span>
          The opposite to fire. Uses slowing and drowning effects on enemies. Its towers look like the element itself: Icy, snowy, water and such stuff. They can contain northern creatures, water and frost elementals.
